  <h2 id="introduction:-the-“good-guess”-problem" tabindex="-1"><a class="heading-anchor-link" href="#introduction:-the-“good-guess”-problem" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Introduction: The “Good Guess” Problem</h2>
<p>We’ve all been there. You’re working on a project, and you ask an AI assistant like Gemini for a code snippet. You ask it to “create a function to handle user uploads,” and it gives you a perfectly functional, textbook-quality piece of code. But it’s not <em>your</em> code. It doesn’t use your project’s custom error handling, it doesn’t know about your specific database client, and it certainly doesn’t follow your team’s unique style conventions.</p>
<p>The AI made a “good guess,” but it lacked the one thing a human developer on your team has intrinsically: <strong>context</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the core challenge of AI-assisted development. These powerful models are incredible at general problem-solving, but they operate in a vacuum, unaware of the specific ecosystem of your project. So, how do we bridge that gap? How do we move beyond just “good guesses” and get consistently reliable, production-ready code from our AI partner?</p>
<h2 id="prompt-engineering-vs--context-engineering:-an-evolution" tabindex="-1"><a class="heading-anchor-link" href="#prompt-engineering-vs--context-engineering:-an-evolution" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering: An Evolution</h2>
<p>For a while, the answer seemed to be <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>. This is the art of crafting the perfect, clever question. It’s like giving a world-class chef a very specific, detailed order for a single dish. It’s powerful, but it’s limited to that one request. If you want a different dish, you have to write a whole new order.</p>
<p>But what if, instead of just giving the chef an order, you prepared the entire kitchen for them? What if you provided them with your pantry’s inventory, your family’s dietary restrictions, and your favorite recipes? Suddenly, the chef can do more than just follow one order; they can cook <em>for you</em>.</p>
<p>That is <strong>Context Engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s the discipline of systematically providing an AI with the full environment—the project rules, the existing code patterns, the required documentation, and the validation steps. It’s the difference between giving the AI a sticky note and handing it the full screenplay.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-gemini-context-engineering-framework" tabindex="-1"><a class="heading-anchor-link" href="#introducing-the-gemini-context-engineering-framework" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Introducing the Gemini Context Engineering Framework</h2>
<p>To make this discipline practical and repeatable, I created the <strong>Gemini Context Engineering Framework</strong>, an open-source project designed to solve this exact problem.</p>
<p>Its mission is simple: to provide a structured, repeatable workflow for building software with Gemini, elevating it from a simple tool to a true development partner.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2025/07-07/context-engineering-icon.png" alt="Blueprint and Gem Icon"></p>
<h2 id="how-it-works:-the-two-step-workflow" tabindex="-1"><a class="heading-anchor-link" href="#how-it-works:-the-two-step-workflow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How It Works: The Two-Step Workflow</h2>
<p>The framework’s power lies in its two-step process, which separates high-level planning from automated implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: The Blueprint (Generation)</strong>
First, you don’t just ask the AI to write code. You start by creating a feature request and running the <code>generate-prp.sh</code> script. This script sends your request to Gemini and asks it to act as a senior engineer, creating a detailed technical plan, or a <strong>Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)</strong>. This forces the AI to think through the entire problem before writing a single line of code.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: The Build (The AI Agent)</strong>
This is where the magic happens. Once you have the PRP, you kick off the <code>execute-prp.sh script</code>. This script is a true <strong>AI agent</strong> that manages the entire development process for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>It sends the detailed PRP to Gemini to get a step-by-step implementation plan.</li>
<li>It <strong>parses</strong> the AI’s response, identifying shell commands to run and code files to create.</li>
<li>It then executes this plan step-by-step, <strong>pausing to ask for your confirmation</strong> before running any command or writing any file.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows you to sit back and supervise as the AI builds the entire feature for you, right in your local terminal, with you in complete control.</p>

<p>Models like Gemini are incredibly powerful and can process vast amounts of context. This framework is designed to leverage that specific strength.</p>
<p>By providing structured context—the project rules in <code>GEMINI.md</code>, code examples in the <code>examples/</code> folder, and a detailed plan in the PRP—you are effectively guiding Gemini’s powerful reasoning capabilities. The result is code that is not just functional, but also consistent with your project’s architecture, style, and conventions.</p>
<p>This workflow dramatically reduces “prompt fatigue” and the frustrating cycle of generating, correcting, and re-generating code. You get it right the first time, more often.</p>

<p>The best way to understand the power of this workflow is to try it yourself.</p>
<p>You can find the complete open-source project on GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Apoo711/context-engineering-gemini">Source code</a></p>
<p>Getting started is simple:</p>
<p><strong>1. Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the <a href="http://README.md">README.md</a> to configure your API key.</strong></p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> clone https://github.com/Apoo711/context-engineering-gemini</code></pre>
<p><strong>2. Create a feature request by copying <a href="http://INITIAL.md">INITIAL.md</a> to a new file named <a href="http://request.md">request.md</a> and filling it out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Generate the plan</strong></p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token comment"># On macOS/Linux</span>
<span class="token function">chmod</span> +x .gemini/scripts/generate-prp.sh
./.gemini/scripts/generate-prp.sh request.md

<span class="token comment"># On Windows</span>
<span class="token function">bash</span> ./.gemini/scripts/generate-prp.sh request.md</code></pre>
<p><strong>4. Execute the plan</strong></p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token comment"># On macOS/Linux</span>
<span class="token function">chmod</span> +x .gemini/scripts/execute-prp.sh
./.gemini/scripts/execute-prp.sh PRPs/request_prp.md

<span class="token comment"># On Windows</span>

<p>Context Engineering is more than just a new way to prompt. It’s a fundamental shift in how we collaborate with AI. By treating our AI assistant not as a magic black box, but as a skilled partner that needs proper briefing, we can unlock a new level of productivity and code quality.</p>
<p>This framework is a starting point. I invite you to explore the repository, try the workflow on your own projects, and see the difference for yourself. Stop settling for “good guesses” and start building with a true AI partner.</p>
